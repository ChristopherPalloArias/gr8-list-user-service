## Microservice Description

The `list-product-service` microservice is responsible for managing the list of products in the MiniMarket inventory. Allows you to list products using an HTTP GET request to the corresponding route.

## Installation

### Requirements

- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Clone the Repository

cd list-product-service
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Start the Server
Before starting the application you must change the database credentials in the index.js file if you want to use the application locally and independently, this is because initially the application is configured to be used in conjunction with the rest of Microservices through Docker-Compose, if you do not want to run the application independently, you must leave the file as it is and subsequently execute the DockerCompose file found in the attached repository, where you will find how to run it, and thus the application It will work together through Docker.
